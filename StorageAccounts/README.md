Microsoft Learn is a great resource for learning Azure.  It's obvious they focused on making their learning material better because previously it was like reading radio instructions.  Now it's so much easier to use and the UI's much better. There are some great projects to help you get familiar with Azure.   Two I'd recommend for understanding Storage Accounts are the Guided Project - Azure Files and Azure Blobs and the Applied Skills for storage accounts.  

This write-up (while I work on the projects) will be about those efforts.  Then I'll work on the file-sharing system, which will be in its own folder.
