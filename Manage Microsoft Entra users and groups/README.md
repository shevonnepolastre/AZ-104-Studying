The Entra ID is essentially the tenant's ID. I was surprised that the cost wasn't linked to the tenant, but then I realized subscriptions were where the resources were stored, so it's easier to budget and invoice for what you use in those subscriptions rather than having everything in one tenant, especially if you can have more than one subscription.
