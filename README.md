# Azure Learning Journey

Welcome to my Azure learning journey! I am excited to share my experiences and findings while I learn Azure. This will give a quick overview of my learning process and to highlight some of the things I've learned along the way.

## Getting Started

### Azure Portal

Before diving into Azure, it is essential to familiarize oneself with the Azure Portal. This web-based tool serves as the primary interface for managing your Azure resources. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating, deploying, and configuring Azure services.

### Azure Documentation

To gain a deeper understanding of Azure, it is essential to refer to official documentation that you can find on Microsoft's training site.  They do a pretty good job of detailing everything you need to know to familiarize yourself with Azure.  Only thing I will say (maybe it's me), but I sometimes have to read it a few times to fully grasp what they are trying to say.  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/

## Learning Objectives

<b>1. Understand Azure Services</b>

As I learn about Azure services, I hope to get a comprehensive understanding. These services include virtual machines, storage accounts, databases, and serverless computing. My goal is to understand how these services fit together and how they can be leveraged for scalable and resilient apps.

<b>2. Implement Azure Infrastructure</b>

Another thing I'm learning is how to set up Azure infrastructure. This includes stuff like creating virtual machines, deploying apps, and configuring storage accounts. It's important for me to gain practical experience with these tasks so I can build a solid foundation in Azure infrastructure management.

There's always more to learn about Azure. As new features, updates, and services are introduced, it's important to stay on top of the latest trends. I want to keep improving my knowledge and skills in Azure by adopting a mindset of continuous learning.
